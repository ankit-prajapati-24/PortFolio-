    about :`👋 Hi, I’m Ankit Prajapat, a dedicated Full Stack Developer and B.Tech CSE student (2021–2025) with a passion for building innovative and user-friendly web applications.

I specialize in the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and have hands-on experience designing responsive, scalable, and efficient web solutions. My projects reflect my commitment to clean code and modern UI design using Tailwind CSS.

Alongside development, I have a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms, which helps me write optimized and performance-driven code. I actively work on enhancing my problem-solving skills through competitive programming and continuous learning.
